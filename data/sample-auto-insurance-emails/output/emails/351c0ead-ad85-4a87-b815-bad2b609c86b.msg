Estimados compaï¿½eros, 

Hoping this email finds you well. In this message, I bring to your attention some important updates that require your swift action.

The first matter pertains to the policy number GE41000077, belonging to Mr. Ricardo Espadas Navarro. I have received information suggesting that the correct series number is not being used for this policy. For your action, the true series number is 1N6AA07A06N518215. Please attend to this immediately and modify the policy accordingly. In case of any concerns or queries, feel free to reach out. 

The second issue deals with a request from Mariana Ocampo Castillo from ODESSA Tek in San Pedro Garza Garcia. She has approached us with the request to assist her in cancelling the policy number K943002456, at the request of her client. Kindly support her in the procedure and ensure that the cancellation is executed promptly.

I appreciate your attention and swift action on these matters. 

Kindly confirm that these tasks have been attained once they are done.

Thank you,

Fernando Almeida.
